Your ad display delegate or <Glossary>callback [postback]</Glossary> interface will receive a call if an ad failed to load or failed to display.
This call will be accompanied by an error code.
This page describes the error codes you may see.

You can retrieve the error code by means of the `AdEventInfo.getErrorCode()` method, which is part of the ad event object that is returned to you in the failure event.

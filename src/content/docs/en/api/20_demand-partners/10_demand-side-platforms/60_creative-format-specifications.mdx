These specifications are ad format agnostic and apply to all ad types supported by AppLovin.

AppLovin recommends that you leverage [the testing process](dsp-testing) to fully understand the user experience for the <Glossary>creative</Glossary> as served through <Glossary>AppLovin Exchange</Glossary>.

## <Abbr>HTML</Abbr>

- Use <Abbr>HTML</Abbr> snippets, not full <Abbr>HTML</Abbr> documents.
- Escape <Abbr>HTML</Abbr> ad markup.
- <Abbr>PNG</Abbr>, <Abbr>JPG</Abbr>/<Abbr>JPEG</Abbr>, and <Abbr>GIF</Abbr> are the supported media formats.
- [<Abbr>MRAID</Abbr>](https://www.iab.com/guidelines/mraid/) 1.0 and 2.0 are supported.
  
## <Abbr>VAST</Abbr>

<Glossary>Inventory</Glossary> that supports [<Abbr>VAST</Abbr>](https://www.iab.com/guidelines/vast/) will pass [the `bid_request.imp.video` object](applovin-ortb-specification#video-object) in the [bid request](applovin-ortb-specification#bid-request).

- The <Abbr>VAST</Abbr> creative must be completely secure, including all <Glossary>tracking</Glossary> and redirect <Abbr>URL</Abbr>s.
- AppLovin supports <Abbr>VAST</Abbr> 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0.
  - <Abbr>VPAID</Abbr> is not supported.
- <Abbr>VAST</Abbr> InLine and Wrapper
- <Abbr>VAST</Abbr> capable inventory is compliant with <Abbr>MRAID</Abbr>.

    Videos that are over 2<Abbr>MB</Abbr> can experience poor performance.
  -   If the request to retrieve the video file exceeds 30 seconds, it is considered a timeout.
- Both landscape and vertical video are supported.
- <Abbr>VAST</Abbr>-capable inventory supports companion (<Abbr>a.k.a.</Abbr> endcard) creative.
  - <Abbr>MRAID</Abbr> companion (<Abbr>a.k.a.</Abbr> endcard) creative is supported.
  - When multiple companion resources are sent, AppLovin uses the following order (if the first one fails, it tries the next one, and so on):
    1. StaticResource
    1. IFrameResource
    1. HTMLResource

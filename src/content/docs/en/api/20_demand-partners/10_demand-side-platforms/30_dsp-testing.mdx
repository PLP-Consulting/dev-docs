After you finish [integrating](applovin-ortb-specification) AppLovin <Glossary>RTB</Glossary>, you can use the AppLovin <Glossary>DSP</Glossary> Platform app to <Abbr>QA</Abbr> your ads.
Make sure to test and confirm that all ad formats and <Glossary>creative</Glossary> types are rendering correctly on the test app before you go live on the <Glossary>AppLovin Exchange</Glossary>.

The bundle <Abbr>ID</Abbr> / package name for the AppLovin test app is `com.applovin.apps.dspdemo`.
You can find the app at the following <Abbr>URL</Abbr>s:

<Glossary>Android [android]</Glossary>

## Launch

When you are ready to launch, AppLovin completes quality-assurance testing and then sets your bidder live with real traffic.
Make sure to turn off test ads and begin using real campaigns at this time.
Applovin begins by sending 1% of live traffic to your endpoint(s).
If AppLovin <Glossary>impression</Glossary> and revenue numbers are aligned, your AppLovin account team continues to increase traffic to your bidder, from 1% to 10% to 100%.

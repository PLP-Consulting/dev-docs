The formats supported on <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> 11.3.0+ are:

- <Glossary>Banner</Glossary> <Abbr>HTML</Abbr>/<Abbr>MRAID</Abbr>
- <Glossary>MREC</Glossary> <Abbr>HTML</Abbr>/<Abbr>MRAID</Abbr>
- <Glossary>Interstitial</Glossary> <Abbr>VAST</Abbr> <Abbr>XML</Abbr> and <Abbr>VAST</Abbr> Tags

Please reach out to your third party viewability vendor (including <Abbr>IAS</Abbr> &amp; Moat) to validate your viewability tags before running viewability campaigns through AppLovin.

## Setting Up Viewability Tags

In order to measure viewability for <Abbr>ALX</Abbr> creatives, you must have a direct relationship with one of the supported viewability vendors.
You can find a list of supported viewability vendors under [Member Companies](https://iabtechlab.com/working-groups/open-measurement-working-group/#Member_Companies) on the Open Measurement Working Group page.
Work with your third party viewability vendor to set up the viewability tags discussed in this section.


Viewability tags are specific to each viewability vendor.
However, in general you can set up viewability tags in the ways described below, depending on the ad format:

- For <Abbr>HTML</Abbr> tags, include your viewability vendors’ <Abbr>OMID</Abbr>/JavaScript tag in the <Abbr>HTML</Abbr> code.
  Work with your viewability vendor to obtain the tag and for guidance on where to insert it in your <Abbr>HTML</Abbr>.
- You can implement <Abbr>VAST</Abbr> <Abbr>XML</Abbr> video measurement tags in-app by adding either an `<Extension>` or `<AdVerifications>` node to your <Abbr>VAST</Abbr> tag.
  For each third-party viewability vendor, work directly with your viewability vendor account representative to learn the specific way they recommend that you integrate the <Abbr>VAST</Abbr> `<Extension>` or `<AdVerifications>` node.

For most verification vendors, the following instructions indicate how to implement the verification nodes:

- For <Abbr>VAST</Abbr> versions pre-4.1, include an extension node below the <Abbr>VAST</Abbr> <Abbr>XML</Abbr>, with the `<AdVerification>` node nested inside, as shown here:
```xml
<Extension type="AdVerifications">
  <AdVerifications>
    <Verification vendor="vendor name">
      <JavaScriptResource apiFramework="omid" browserOptional="true">
        <![CDATA[]]>
      </JavaScriptResource>
      <TrackingEvents>
        <Tracking event="verificationNotExecuted">
          <![CDATA[]]>
        </Tracking>
      </TrackingEvents>
      <VerificationParameters>
        <![CDATA[“Vendor name”]]>
      </VerificationParameters>
    </Verification>
  </AdVerifications>
</Extension>
```
- For VAST 4.1, include the `<AdVerifications>` node directly below the <Abbr>VAST</Abbr> <Abbr>XML</Abbr>, as shown here:
```xml
<AdVerifications>
  <Verification vendor="vendor name">
    <JavaScriptResource apiFramework="omid" browserOptional="true">
      <![CDATA[]]>
    </JavaScriptResource>
    <TrackingEvents>
      <Tracking event="verificationNotExecuted">
        <![CDATA[]]>
      </Tracking>
    </TrackingEvents>
    <VerificationParameters>
      <![CDATA[“Vendor name”]]>
    </VerificationParameters>
  </Verification>
</AdVerifications>undefined</Extension>
``` 

## Testing Your Viewability Tags

To test your viewability tags, set up your viewability bid responses as per [the test app instructions](dsp-testing), and run test impressions in the test app.

From there, you can work with your viewability vendor to confirm <Glossary>tracking</Glossary> is correct.
They will instruct you to collect charles logs and track certain calls made by their tags, and/or review reporting in their own viewability platform.

<Callout type="note">
<Abbr>OMSDK</Abbr> tags and <Glossary>postback</Glossary> calls must use secure (<Abbr>HTTPS</Abbr>) <Abbr>URL</Abbr>s.
</Callout>

## Bid Responses

To help your viewability partner communicate with the AppLovin <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> properly, you can include the <Abbr>OMID</Abbr>-1 <Abbr>API</Abbr> (value = “7”) in the <Abbr>API</Abbr> array of your bid response ([`bidresponse.bid.apis`](applovin-ortb-specification#bid-object)).
Refer to [the AppLovin Open<Abbr>RTB</Abbr> 2.5 spec](applovin-ortb-specification) for details.

## Reporting

You can receive viewability reporting on your ads if you have a direct relationship with a third-party viewability vendor.
In order to collect viewability measurement on your campaigns, include the third-party measurement tags in your creatives and bid responses by following the instructions above and those from your vendor.

All apps on supported <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> versions automatically integrate with and opt into <Abbr>OMSDK</Abbr>.
You can receive viewability reporting for your integrated ads on apps that run a supported <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> version.

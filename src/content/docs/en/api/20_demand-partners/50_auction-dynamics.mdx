The MAX <Glossary>In-App Bidding</Glossary> Exchange is a first-price, fair and transparent, unified first-price auction in which the highest bidder wins.
All <Glossary>SDK</Glossary> in-app bidders and <Glossary>DSPs</Glossary> have equal access to each ad <Glossary>impression</Glossary> opportunity and receive full notification coverage with enhanced macros.

The MAX In-App Bidding Exchange collects bids for individual impression opportunities from <Abbr>SDK</Abbr>-based demand partners and <Abbr>DSP</Abbr>s by using the Open<Glossary>RTB</Glossary> 2.5 protocol.
To integrate with MAX, a bidder must comply with the Open<Abbr>RTB</Abbr> 2.5 <Abbr>API</Abbr>.

For the latest version of the MAX in-app bidding spec for <Abbr>SDK</Abbr>-based in-app bidders, see [the AppLovin <Abbr>oRTB</Abbr> Specification page](https://support.applovin.com/hc/en-us/articles/11623322707085)

## MAX Ad Serving Flow

![Device: Publisher App makes Ad Request to MAX SDK; Token abc goes to Demand Source 1 Adapter and then to Demand Source 1 SDK; Token def goes to Demand Source 2 Adapter and then to Demand Source 2 SDK; Ad Request with both tokens goes to MAX Ad Server. MAX Server: Waterfall goes to Max Ad Server which communicates with AppLovin Exchange. Third Party Server: Demand Source Bidders send bid responses to MAX Ad Server and get bid requests with tokens in return. AppLovin Exchange communicates with DSPs one through three.](/images/auction-dynamics-01.png)

  1. The user launches the app.
  1. MAX initializes all eligible <Abbr>SDK</Abbr>s. 
  1. The publisher requests an ad.
  1. For <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> bidders, MAX collects bid tokens from initialized <Abbr>SDK</Abbr>s. 
  1. MAX <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> makes an ad request to MAX ad server.
  1. MAX auction server requests bids from eligible <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> bidder endpoints and <Abbr>DSP</Abbr>s in <Glossary>AppLovin Exchange</Glossary>.
     Identity tokens are passed in the bid request to <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> bidders.
  1. Real-time bids returned by <Abbr>DSP</Abbr>s and <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> bidders within the maximum timeout threshold (tmax) are merged with the non-bidding demand sources in the publisher <Glossary>waterfall</Glossary>.
  1. MAX auction server resolves the auction based on the highest <Glossary>CPM</Glossary> value.
  1. MAX sends loss notifications to bidders that lose the auction due to error or invalid bid (e.g. below the floor, missing bid value, zero as bid price).
  1. If the winner is a <Abbr>DSP</Abbr>, MAX notifies the <Abbr>DSP</Abbr> and AppLovin <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> is asked to load and show the ad.
     If the winner is an <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> bidder, MAX notifies the winning demand partner’s <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> to load and show the ad.
  1. If the load succeeds, MAX sends a win notification to the bidder.
     If the load does not succeed, MAX sends a loss notification to the bidder.
  1. MAX calls the winner’s billing <Abbr>URL</Abbr> after the ad renders.

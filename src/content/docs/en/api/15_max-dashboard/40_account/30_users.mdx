In the <UILabel>Users</UILabel> section of the AppLovin dashboard you can add additional users to your account and give them a variety of access options across MAX and AppDiscovery.
You can also perform general account administration.

You can give users full access to your account or you can limit their access to reporting, ad management, and payment information, for all your apps or a select few.

To begin, open [<UILabel>Account &gt; Manage &gt; Users</UILabel>](https://dash.applovin.com/o/account#users) in your AppLovin dashboard.
Then click <UILabel>Add New Users</UILabel>.
Add the userâ€™s name, email address, password, and access permissions.
The new user can return to the <Abbr>UI</Abbr> and update their password if they desire.

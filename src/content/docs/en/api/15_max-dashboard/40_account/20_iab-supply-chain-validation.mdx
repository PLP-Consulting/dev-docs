The Interactive Advertising Bureau (<Abbr>IAB</Abbr>) created <Glossary>`app-ads.txt` [app-ads.txt]</Glossary> as a way for app publishers to prove to advertisers that they own the app that originates an ad request.
App publishers host this text file on the website that is linked from the Google Play Store and/or Apple App Store.
This file includes a reference to all ad sources that are authorized to sell your app inventory.
You make this file publicly available and crawlable by <Glossary>exchanges [ad exchange]</Glossary>, <Glossary>supply-side platforms</Glossary> (<Abbr>SSP</Abbr>s), other buyers, and third-party vendors.

When an app sends out an ad request, an advertiser can check the app store page for the developer website, find the corresponding `app-ads.txt` file at that site, and verify that the publisher <Abbr>ID</Abbr> in the ad request matches the <Abbr>ID</Abbr> in the `app-ads.txt` file.
This prevents a malicious actor from faking ad requests from an app, because the publisher <Abbr>ID</Abbr> in their ad request will not match the publisher <Abbr>ID</Abbr> included in the `app-ads.txt` file.

Many advertisers will not bid on apps that do not have a valid `app-ads.txt` file.

<Callout type="note">
As per [the <Abbr>IAB</Abbr> `Sellers.json` spec](https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sellers.json_Final.pdf), you can use only one domain per Seller <Abbr>ID</Abbr> (MAX Account).
It is invalid for a `seller_id` to represent multiple entities.
</Callout>

To maximize the number of <Glossary>bidders [in-app bidding]</Glossary> who bid on your app inventory, maximize your revenue, and safeguard your app against certain types of fraud, AppLovin strongly recommends that you maintain an `app-ads.txt` file and that you include AppLovin as an authorized ad source in that file.

## How to Implement an `app-ads.txt` File
1. Add your developer website to the app store.
   You must link your developer website in your store listings in Google Play and/or the App Store so that AppLovin and other ad platforms can establish your app’s ownership.
   - For Google Play, add your developer website <Abbr>URL</Abbr> in the Developer contact section of your app listing:
     1. Sign in to your Play Console.
     1. Select your app.
     1. In the menu on the left, select <UILabel>Store presence &gt; Store listing</UILabel>.
     1. Scroll to <UILabel>Developer contact</UILabel>.
     1. Add your developer website <Abbr title="uniform resource locator">URL</Abbr>.
   - For the Apple App Store, place your `app-ads.txt` file at the same domain that you use for <UILabel>App Privacy</UILabel>.
1. Create your `app-ads.txt` file.
   Add the `app-ads.txt` file to the root directory of your developer website.
   In this file, list all authorized sellers of your app inventory.
   To do this, ask each of the <Glossary>ad networks</Glossary> that you connected to your app for the relevant lines you should add to your `app-ads.txt` file.

   You must format your `app-ads.txt` file according to the specifications of the <Abbr>IAB</Abbr> Tech Lab so that your file can be successfully verified by those who use it.
   Review the [Authorized Sellers for Apps specification](https://www.iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/app-ads.txt-v1.0-final-.pdf) provided by the <Abbr>IAB</Abbr> Tech Lab.
   <Callout type="note">
   You must use `utf-8` character encoding in your `app-ads.txt` file.
   Your web server must serve this file as `Content-type: text/plain`.
   </Callout>
1. Add AppLovin to your `app-ads.txt` file.
   You can find the relevant AppLovin lines to add to your `app-ads.txt` file at the [<UILabel>Account &gt; General &gt; App-ads.txt Info</UILabel>](https://dash.applovin.com/o/account#app_ads_txt) page in the AppLovin Dashboard.
1. Register the root domain of your developer website <Abbr>URL</Abbr> (for example: `mywebsite.com`) in the <UILabel>Domain</UILabel> field at [<UILabel>Account &gt; General &gt; Basic Info</UILabel>](https://dash.applovin.com/o/account#basic_info) in the AppLovin Dashboard.
   As per [the <Abbr>IAB</Abbr> specification](https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sellers.json_Final.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A17%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C70%2C528%2C0%5D), you can use only one `domain` in the <Glossary>`sellers.json` [sellers.json]</Glossary> file that AppLovin manages.
   If your MAX account is used by multiple studios or game developers then choose one of the following two options:
   - Use the same developer website <Abbr>URL</Abbr> in the store listings for all the apps that you manage with your AppLovin account.
   - If you cannot use the same developer website for all of the apps that you manage with the MAX account, then each of the developer websites must establish an <Abbr>HTTP</Abbr> redirect that diverts requests for the `app-ads.txt` file at these developer websites to the `app-ads.txt` file that you host on the <UILabel>Domain</UILabel> that you enter into your MAX Account.
      As per the <Abbr>IAB</Abbr> Spec, [“Only a single <Abbr>HTTP</Abbr> redirect to a destination outside the original root domain is allowed to facilitate one-hop delegation of authority to a third party’s web server domain. If the third party location returns a redirect, then the advertising system should treat the response as an error.”](https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sellers.json_Final.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A10%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C70%2C279%2C0%5D)
      For example, the MAX Account “Animal Kingdom” manages the apps from the following studios:
      - Studio Bears
      - Studio Tigers
      - Studio Monkeys

      The owner of the MAX Account should host an `app-ads.txt` file on `animalkingdom.com` and use `animalkingdom.com` as the Domain in the MAX <Abbr>UI</Abbr> (which is then published to AppLovin’s `seller.json` file).
      The studios set the developer websites in the store for their apps to be their sites— `www.studiobears.com` or `www.studiotigers.com` or `www.studiomonkeys.com`.
      These studios must redirect requests for the `app-ads.txt` file at the domain of the developer websites indicated in the app store—`www.studiobears.com/app-ads.txt` or `www.studiotigers.com/app-ads.txt` or `www.studiomonkeys.com/app-ads.txt`—to `animalkingdom.com/app-ads.txt`.

### Example
Here is an example `app-ads.txt` file:

```plaintext title="app-ads.txt"
# Network Name, Publisher/Account ID, Relationship Type
applovin.com, 9eaf9ad6dc92d5fcn6f47c30168fb8fq, DIRECT
mintegral.com, 19435, DIRECT, 0aeed123c80d6423
google.com, pub-3940498599942544, DIRECT, f08c47fec0986fa0
```
## Best Practices
- Double-check that you accurately copied-and-pasted each network line entry into your `app-ads.txt` file.
- Reach out to all of your integrated ad partners (networks, exchanges, buyers, and so forth) to request their `app-ads.txt` entry for your file.
  Check with them regularly for updates.
- Be careful of unknown companies reaching out directly and requesting to be added to your `app-ads.txt` file.
  AppLovin strongly advises that you only list companies that you and your <em>direct</em> <Glossary>SSP</Glossary> partners work with.
- Use the helpful [ads.txt Validator](https://adstxt.guru/validator/) website to validate that your `app-ads.txt` entries are correct and up-to-date.
- Check your `app-ads.txt` integration by using the Mediation Debugger.
  Here is an example of how the Mediation Debugger appears when you have successfully integrated `app-ads.txt`:

  ![MAX. SDK Version: 11.6.0. Plugin Version: None. Ad Review Version: ❌. app-ads.txt: ✅](/images/app-ads-txt-01.png)

<Callout type="note">
<Glossary>SDK</Glossary> v11.6.0 may show an inaccurate integration error.

Scheduled reporting is available for Advanced Reports, Network Comparison Reports, and <Glossary>ALX</Glossary> Reports.
You can have a report delivered to your inbox at a frequency you specify.
To establish a new scheduled report in advanced reporting, first create the report with your choice of metrics, date range, and filters.
After you run the report, open the drop-down menu in the top right corner:

![Advanced Reporting. Run Report button. ☑ Day, ☐ Hour, ☐ Master Publishing Account (MPA) checkboxes. Select a Saved Report drop-down menu: Edit/Update Report option, Save as New Report option, Delete Report option.](/images/scheduled-reporting-01.png)

last eight days relative to the day of the report each day.

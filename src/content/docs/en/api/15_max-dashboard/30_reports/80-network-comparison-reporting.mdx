The Network Comparison report helps you identify and address reporting discrepancies between MAX and <Glossary>network</Glossary> partners.
It centralizes MAX- and network-reported data into one dashboard so you can compare stats without having to download multiple reports.
The dashboard metrics include <Glossary>impressions</Glossary>, <Glossary>CPM</Glossary>, and revenue and the report calculates the differences between the two platforms.

Use this report to validate that network <Abbr>CPM</Abbr>s are aligned with <Abbr>CPM</Abbr>s reported in MAX.
Because network data powers auto-<Abbr>CPM</Abbr> updating and <Glossary>bidding</Glossary>, it is important that you ensure MAX is pulling in accurate information for networks competing in the unified auction so you do not lose revenue.

Before you use the report, [connect your networks](../networks/connect-networks) on the <UILabel>Networks</UILabel> page.
From there, navigate to [<UILabel>MAX &gt; Mediation &gt; Debug Reports &gt; Network Comparison</UILabel>](https://dash.applovin.com/o/mediation/network_comparison_report).
The <span class="uilabel"><Abbr>CPM</Abbr> Delta</span> metric is a great starting point for identifying discrepancy issues.
Include network placement, application, ad type, and country (if applicable) in the report filters for a granular breakdown to identify discrepancy issues.

<Callout type="note">
If you donâ€™t see your network appear in the report, try reconnecting to the network on the <UILabel>Networks</UILabel> page.

You may see higher discrepancies between network and MAX numbers at launch and when user adoption rates are low, but this should stabilize as adoption increases.

If there are discrepancies greater than 5% for one or more network placement <Abbr>ID</Abbr>s after full adoption, reach out to your account team or submit a support ticket for assistance troubleshooting.

For instructions on how to enable verbose logs via the output console / logcat, see the Advanced Settings page for your platform.

To verify that you enabled verbose logs successfully, check for this line — `Verbose Logging On: true` — in the AppLovin <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> initialization block:

```plaintext
========================================
AppLovin SDK
Version: 9.13.4
⋮
Verbose Logging On: true
⋮
========================================
```

You can then find AppLovin verbose logs in logcat or XCode terminal as lines that start with `/AppLovinSdk: [AppLovinSdk]`.

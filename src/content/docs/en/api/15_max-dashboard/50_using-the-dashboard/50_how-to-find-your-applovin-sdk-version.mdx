You can discover which AppLovin <Glossary>SDK</Glossary> version you are using in multiple ways:

## Log

The AppLovin <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> prints the <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> version to the log as part of the initialization process.
You will find these lines in the device log:

```plaintext
========================================
AppLovin SDK
Version: «X».«XX».«X»
```

## Native Android
### Programmatically

You can retrieve the version programmatically through a field in the <Abbr>SDK</Abbr>.
The following code snippets show how to do this in Java and Kotlin:

```java title="Java"
String version = AppLovinSdk.VERSION;
int versionCode = AppLovinSdk.VERSION_CODE;
```
```kotlin title="Kotlin"
val version : String = AppLovinSdk.VERSION
val versionCode : Int = AppLovinSdk.VERSION_CODE
```

### AppLovin MAX Mediation Debugger

You can find the version in the Mediation Debugger, which you can show in your app by means of an <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> method (after the <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> initializes).
The following code snippets show how to do this in Java and Kotlin:

```java title="Java"
AppLovinSdk.getInstance(this).showMediationDebugger();
```  
```kotlin title="Kotlin"
AppLovinSdk.getInstance(this).showMediationDebugger()
```  
  
## Native iOS
### Programmatically

You can retrieve the version programmatically by means of a property in the <Abbr>SDK</Abbr>.
The following code snippets show how to do this in Objective-C and Swift:

```objective-c title="Objective-C"
NSString *version = [ALSdk version];
NSUInteger versionCode = [ALSdk versionCode];
```
```swift title="Swift"
var version : String = ALSdk.version()
var versionCode : UInt = ALSdk.versionCode
```
  
### AppLovin MAX Mediation Debugger

You can find the version in the Mediation Debugger, which you can show in your app by means of an <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> method (after the <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> initializes).
The following code snippets show how to do this in Objective-C and Swift:

```objective-c title="Objective-C"
[[ALSdk shared] showMediationDebugger];
```
```swift title="Swift"
ALSdk.shared()!.showMediationDebugger()
```

## Unity (MAX Plugin)
### AppLovin MAX Mediation Debugger

You can find the version in the Mediation Debugger, which you can show in your app by means of an <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> method (after the <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> initializes):

```csharp title="C#"
MaxSdk.ShowMediationDebugger();
```

You create a new app in your dashboard every time you initialize the <Glossary>SDK</Glossary> with your <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> key in a new app (a new app is one with a unique combination of bundle <Abbr>ID</Abbr> and platform).

If you have unwanted apps in your dashboard (for example, because you used your <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> key in a test build), you can hide them.

### To Hide an App
1. Log in to [your AppLovin dashboard](https://dash.applovin.com/).
1. Select [<UILabel>AppDiscovery &gt; Monetization &gt; Manage &gt; Applications</UILabel>](https://dash.applovin.com/o/manage).
1. Click <UILabel>Hide/Unhide Apps</UILabel>.
   If you do not see that option, select <UILabel>ðŸ…° All Applications</UILabel> from the drop-down menu, then that option should appear.
1. Check the box next to the app(s) you want to hide.
1. Click <UILabel>Hide Selected Apps</UILabel>.
  
### To Rename an App
1. Log in to [your AppLovin dashboard](https://dash.applovin.com/).
1. Select [<UILabel>AppDiscovery &gt; Monetization &gt; Manage &gt; Applications</UILabel>](https://dash.applovin.com/o/manage).
1. Choose the app you want to rename.
   The <UILabel>Edit Application</UILabel> page appears.
   <Callout type="tip">
   If you were already on the <UILabel>Edit Application</UILabel> page for an app other than the one you want to rename, select the app you want to rename from the drop-down menu to the right of the <UILabel>Edit Application</UILabel> title.
   </Callout>

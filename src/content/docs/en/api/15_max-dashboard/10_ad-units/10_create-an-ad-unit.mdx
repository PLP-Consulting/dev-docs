Create an ad unit for each ad format that you want to use in your application.
You manage your <Glossary>monetization [app monetization]</Glossary> by means of a <Glossary>waterfall</Glossary> on the ad unit’s dashboard page.

To create an ad unit, first open [<UILabel>MAX &gt; Mediation &gt; Manage &gt; Ad Units</UILabel>](https://dash.applovin.com/o/mediation/ad_units/) in the AppLovin dashboard.

To create an ad unit for an existing app in the app store, click <UILabel>Create Your Ad Unit</UILabel> in the top-right.
The <UILabel>Create New Ad Unit</UILabel> page appears.
Name your ad unit, and choose your application’s platform and ad format.

![Ad Units &gt; New Ad Unit. Create New Ad Unit. Name input field. Platform radio buttons: Android, Fire OS, iOS. Ad Type radio buttons: Banner, Interstitial, MREC, Native, Rewarded.](/images/create-ad-unit-01.png)

<Callout type="note">

If you do not see any content in the AppLovin dashboard, only a spinning icon, you may be using a browser extension that interferes with MAX.
To fix this, disable your browser extensions and then reload the AppLovin dashboard.
</Callout>

Next, enter your application’s name, package name, bundle <Abbr>ID</Abbr>, or numerical iTunes <Abbr>ID</Abbr> in the input box.
If your input matches your live app, choose it from the drop-down that appears:

![Add Your App. To get started, please choose the platform and enter the application name. ● Android, ○ iOS. “demoapp”](/images/create-ad-unit-03.png)

If your app is not yet live, you can add it to MAX.
To do this, click <UILabel>manually add your package name</UILabel>, then type in your app’s package name, with capitalization that exactly matches what you have in your app code.

![No results found. You can search for apps that are live in the play store to select an app or manually add your package name for apps that are not live in the store. Note that package names used are case sensitive.](/images/create-ad-unit-04.png)

MAX does not officially support alternative app stores (such as Huawei App Gallery), but you can mediate such inventory with MAX at your own risk by using this <UILabel>manually add your package name</UILabel> process.

## Multiple Ad Units per Ad Format

AppLovin strongly recommends that you use a single ad unit <Abbr>ID</Abbr> for each format within an app.
This ensures an ad is always cached and avoids unnecessary app/user bandwidth usage.

If you use the same ad format in multiple placements within your app, you can name and tag each one within the <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> to measure the performance of each unique placement.
Learn how to do this in the Advanced Settings: Ad Placements section for your platform in this documentation.

## Building Your Waterfall

After you add your app and ad unit, you see a list of <Glossary>ad networks</Glossary> that are available for you to add to your waterfall.

The Default Waterfall is your primary waterfall for monetization.
After you configure your ad networks, MAX automates waterfall management through a combination of <Glossary>in-app bidding</Glossary> and <Glossary>CPM</Glossary> updating.
You have to build custom waterfalls if you want to tailor monetization and ad experience for specific users or devices.
Learn more about this feature in the [Waterfall Segmentation and Cloning](https://dash.applovin.com/documentation/mediation/features/waterfall-segmentation) page in this documentation.

![Default Waterfall. Bidder Networks list. Other Networks list.](/images/create-ad-unit-05.png)

You can add the following demand sources to your waterfall:

Bidding Networks:
: <Abbr>SDK</Abbr>-based networks that compete simultaneously in a <Glossary>real-time auction [RTB]</Glossary> to serve an <Glossary>impression</Glossary>.

Other Networks:
: Traditionally-<Glossary>mediated</Glossary>, <Abbr>SDK</Abbr>-based networks that sequentially respond to an ad request within a waterfall prioritized by the highest <Abbr>CPM</Abbr> price.

Custom Networks:
: <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> networks that are not officially supported by AppLovin.
  You can work directly with such a network to build a connection to MAX.

Direct Sold:
: Advertiser-direct campaigns with advanced targeting options and the ability to set campaign goals.
  You can also use this feature for promo campaigns.
  Learn more in the [Direct Sold](https://dash.applovin.com/documentation/mediation/features/direct-sold) documentation page.

  Review the [Enabling Networks](enabling-networks) and [Advanced Setup](advanced-setup) documentation to learn how to activate these demand sources in your waterfall.

## Visualizing Waterfalls

To see how your ad partners rank in the waterfall click the <UILabel>⋯</UILabel> to the right of <UILabel>Bidder Networks</UILabel> and select <UILabel>Preview Waterfall</UILabel>.
Then choose the country for which you want to see the waterfall configuration.

![Waterfall Preview. Please select a country to preview the waterfall based on the manually entered CPM values in the MAX ad unit page. Note that the changes made on the ad unit page will be reflected in the waterfall preview immediately. Country input. Bidder Networks. Other Networks.](/images/create-ad-unit-06.png)

## Set Ad Unit Settings (optional)

After you create your ad unit, you can set a frequency cap for <Glossary>full-screen [interstitial ads]</Glossary> and <Glossary>rewarded [rewarded ads]</Glossary> formats or you can set the refresh interval for <Glossary>banner</Glossary> and <Glossary>MREC</Glossary> formats.
You can also change these values later.

## Bid Floor (optional)

The bid floor ensures no ads are served at less than a <Abbr>CPM</Abbr> value you choose.
You can set a bid floor by country or region.
Because this limits the number of ads you receive, AppLovin recommends that you keep this disabled to avoid any negative impact to revenue or <Glossary>fill [fill rate]</Glossary>.

With MAX, <Glossary>in-app bidding</Glossary> <Glossary>networks</Glossary> have direct relationships with you.
Networks pay you based on their payment windows and their final numbers.
If you have any payment-related questions, work directly with your network partner to resolve them.

If you are new to <Glossary>monetization [app monetization]</Glossary> and you need help in setting up your networks, read the Mediated Network Guides for your platform.

To activate networks for one of your ad units within MAX, navigate to the <UILabel>Ad Units</UILabel> page, select the ad unit, then scroll down the <UILabel>Default Waterfall</UILabel> which includes all supported networks.
Only enable those networks for which you successfully integrated the <Glossary>SDK</Glossary> and which you [connected to MAX](../networks/connect-networks).

Bidder Networks:
: To activate a bidder network, first click the arrow drop-down to the right of the network name.
  This expands the section for that network.
  Add your network <Abbr>ID</Abbr>s and click the <UILabel>Status</UILabel> toggle to turn the network on.
  (AppLovin demand is enabled by default and no other actions are required to receive its ads.)<br />

Other Networks:
: To activate one of the other networks, first click the arrow drop-down to the right of the network name.
  This expands the section for that network.
  Add your network <Abbr>ID</Abbr>s, <UILabel><Abbr>CPM</Abbr> Price</UILabel> (this should mirror the price floor that you set with the network and associated with the network <Abbr>ID</Abbr>), and <UILabel>Country Targeting</UILabel> if applicable.
  If you have multiple network <Abbr>ID</Abbr>s, click <UILabel>Add a New Ad Unit <Abbr>ID</Abbr></UILabel> to repeat the process.<br />

  [Auto-<abbr title="cost per mille">CPM</abbr>](https://dash.applovin.com/documentation/mediation/ui-max/networks/auto-cpm):
  : After you connect your network, auto-<Glossary>CPM</Glossary> activates within a day or two to sync with the actual <Glossary>eCPM</Glossary> the network pays you.

Custom Networks:
: If you have not done so already, create your custom network on the <UILabel>Networks</UILabel> tab.
  Your network then shows up in the relevant formatâ€™s <Glossary>waterfall</Glossary>.
  You can turn on the network by clicking the drop-down arrow to the right of the network name and moving the <UILabel>Status</UILabel> toggle to the on position.

Direct Sold Campaigns:
: To enable this feature, contact your account team or [the support team](https://support.applovin.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for assistance.
  Then follow the instructions on [the Direct Sold page](https://dash.applovin.com/documentation/mediation/features/direct-sold) to set up a campaign.

## App <Abbr>ID</Abbr> Validation

For networks within the same ad unit, both in the same waterfall and intra-waterfall, AppLovin validates that app-level network <Abbr>ID</Abbr>s are consistent throughout, to prevent initialization issues.
If there is an app <Abbr>ID</Abbr> level mismatch for a network, you cannot save the ad unit and you see an error with the network, for example:

![Ogury cannot be enabled with different Asset Key](/images/enable-networks-04.png)
<Callout type="note">
  This does not apply to Pangle in China. AppLovin allows you to enter different app <abbr title="identifier">ID</abbr>s for the bidding and the traditional instance.
</Callout>

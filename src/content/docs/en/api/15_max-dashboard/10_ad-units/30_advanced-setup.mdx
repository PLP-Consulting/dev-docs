Access these features from the <UILabel>Ad Units</UILabel> page:

## Waterfall Segmentation and Cloning

<UILabel>Waterfall Segmentation</UILabel> and <UILabel>Advanced Targeting</UILabel> enable you to tailor the ad experience to certain user segments or devices.
You do this by creating custom <Glossary>waterfalls</Glossary>.
You can establish specific pricing for users who have <Glossary>Limit Ad Tracking</Glossary> enabled or can target unique user audiences with keyword targeting.

<UILabel>Waterfall Cloning</UILabel> allows you to copy existing waterfalls, which saves you time when you create new ones.

## Direct Sold

Use the direct sold feature to run campaigns from direct advertisers, and to prioritize them in the waterfall above <Glossary>network</Glossary> partners if you desire.
You can also use this feature to run house or promotional campaigns.

## A/B Testing

<UILabel>AB Tests</UILabel> allow you to use real-time data to test any change that you make to your waterfall configuration, and to measure the impact of that change.
You can experiment with different ad monetization strategies (for example: add or remove a new network or price points to measure the performance impact) and can identify opportunities that will maximize users’ <Glossary>lifetime value</Glossary> (<Abbr>LTV</Abbr>).

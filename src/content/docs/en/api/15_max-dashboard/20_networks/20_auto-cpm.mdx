Auto-<Glossary>CPM</Glossary> automates <Abbr>CPM</Abbr> updating for non-bidding <Glossary>networks</Glossary>.
This aligns the <Abbr>CPM</Abbr> price for a network placement <Abbr>ID</Abbr> in the MAX Dashboard with the network-reported <Abbr>CPM</Abbr>.

The <Abbr>CPM</Abbr> price updates daily according to the average network <Abbr>CPM</Abbr> for the last seven days.
Auto-<Abbr>CPM</Abbr> supports ad unit/network placement/country granularity.
The network <Abbr>ID</Abbr> must have at least 1,000 <Glossary>impressions</Glossary> in the last seven days to enable <Abbr>CPM</Abbr> updating within MAX.

<Callout type="note">
MAX applies heavier weighting to more recent data in its seven day look-back.
This may cause adjusted <Abbr>CPM</Abbr> to not exactly match the average <Abbr>CPM</Abbr>.

Networks whose reporting does not break down to ad unit/network <Abbr>ID</Abbr>/country granularity are not eligible for auto-<Abbr>CPM</Abbr>.
Custom networks are also not eligible for auto-<Abbr>CPM</Abbr>.
</Callout>

Auto-<Abbr>CPM</Abbr> allows for fair competition between all networks in the unified auction because it uses accurate pricing.
This also reduces the work of manually updating <Abbr>CPM</Abbr>s which can lead to inaccurate or decreased revenue.

If you do not enable auto-<Abbr>CPM</Abbr>, MAX uses the value for <Abbr>CPM</Abbr> price that you enter manually.

## Activating Auto-<abbr title="cost per mille">CPM</abbr>

To activate auto-<abbr title="cost per mille">CPM</abbr>, follow these steps:

1. Manually add the network price floor for each network placement <Abbr>ID</Abbr> in the <Glossary>waterfall(s)</Glossary> on the <UILabel>Ad Unit</UILabel> page.
   It’s important that the MAX <Abbr>CPM</Abbr> price initially matches the network <Abbr>CPM</Abbr> floor or historical <Abbr>CPM</Abbr> to avoid data discrepancies later.
1. Open the <UILabel>Networks</UILabel> page ([<UILabel>MAX &gt; Mediation &gt; Manage &gt; Networks</UILabel>](https://dash.applovin.com/o/mediation/networks)) and connect the network that you want to <Glossary>mediate</Glossary> by entering the network <Abbr>API</Abbr> credentials.
1. Click the <UILabel>Connect</UILabel> button for the network that you want to activate.
   The <UILabel>Manage Network</UILabel> page appears.
   For non-bidding networks, you will see a toggle with which you can turn on auto-<Abbr>CPM</Abbr>.
   <Glossary>Bidding</Glossary> networks submit <Glossary>real-time bid</Glossary> pricing and so they do not utilize auto-<Abbr>CPM</Abbr>.

Any network placement <Abbr>ID</Abbr>s that are governed by auto-<Abbr>CPM</Abbr> will show the <Abbr>CPM</Abbr> price grayed-out in the waterfall.
Click the info <UILabel>ⓘ</UILabel> button within the <Abbr>CPM</Abbr> price field for options either to override auto-<Abbr>CPM</Abbr> by manually entering the <Abbr>CPM</Abbr> or to see a detailed breakdown of the <Abbr>CPM</Abbr> values used.

<Callout type="warning">
To ensure that auto-<Abbr>CPM</Abbr> works with accurate data, use the [Network Comparison Report](https://dash.applovin.com/documentation/mediation/ui-max/reports/network-comparison) to check for <Abbr>CPM</Abbr> and revenue discrepancies on a weekly basis.
If there are discrepancies greater than 5%, use the report to identify the affected network <Abbr>ID</Abbr>s, then contact your account team or submit a support ticket for assistance with troubleshooting.

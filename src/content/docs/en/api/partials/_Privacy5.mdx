## Google Play Families Policy (Android)

This section concerns updates to the [Google Play Families Policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9898834) and outlines certain related updates to your use of the AppLovin <Abbr>SDK</Abbr>.
You can find complete details on Google Play’s Policy Center.

### Who does this policy apply to?

According to Google, if you serve ads in your app and your target audience only includes children, then you must use only [Families Self-Certified Ads <Abbr>SDK</Abbr>s](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9900633/?sjid=4660822843944323705-NC).
If the target audience for your app includes both children and older users you must comply with [Google Play Families Policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9893335) and ensure that ads shown to children come exclusively from Families Self-Certified Ads <Abbr>SDK</Abbr>s.

### What does this mean for your use of the AppLovin <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> and MAX?

As explained in [AppLovin’s Terms of Use](https://www.applovin.com/terms/), the AppLovin Services are not to be used in apps exclusively designed for, or exclusively directed to, children.
AppLovin does not knowingly collect personal information from children or serve advertisements to children.

As for mixed audience or “everyone” apps that may include children as users, as explained in [AppLovin Policies for Publishers](https://www.applovin.com/policies-publishers/), you must include and honor all age-related flags.
If you flag a user as an age-restricted user, AppLovin will not collect personal information from or serve advertisements to that user.
Additionally, because Google requires that ads shown to children come exclusively from Families Self-Certified Ads <Abbr>SDK</Abbr>s, those ads <Abbr>SDK</Abbr>s that have not self-certified compliance with Google Play policies, such as the Families Self-Certified Ads <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> requirements, are not eligible to participate in MAX auctions.

These are the main requirements and implications:

If your app is designed primarily for children under the age of 13:
: <ul><li>Google Play requires that you participate in [Designed for Families](https://play.google.com/about/families/) program and comply with [Google Play’s Families Policy Requirements](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/topic/9877766#!?zippy_activeEl=families-policy#families-policy).</li><li>AppLovin Services are not to be used in apps exclusively directed to children. Please see [AppLovin’s Terms of Use](https://www.applovin.com/terms/).</li></ul>
  
If your app is designed for everyone, including children:
: <ul><li>You must adhere to [Google Play’s Families Policy Requirements](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/topic/9877766#!?zippy_activeEl=families-policy#families-policy).</li><li>Visit the <UILabel>Manage Applications</UILabel> page under <UILabel>AppDiscovery</UILabel> in the AppLovin <Abbr>UI</Abbr> and select the setting <UILabel>Please check this box if your application needs to comply with Google Play’s Families policy</UILabel>. You must review the age data of your users and identify any age-restricted users in your AppLovin <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> integration. For integration instructions, see [“How to set <Abbr>GDPR</Abbr> flags”](https://support.applovin.com/hc/en-us/articles/4426832096141-How-to-set-GDPR-flags). If you enable this setting then your app will not transmit the Advertising <Abbr>ID</Abbr> for children and users of unknown age.</li></ul>

If your app is not designed for children:
: <ul><li>You must still meet the requirements outlined in the [Google Play Developer Program Policies](https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html) and [Developer Distribution Agreement](https://play.google.com/intl/ALL_us/about/developer-distribution-agreement.html).</li></ul>

MAX Demo App is a sample app that demonstrates how you can integrate MAX into your mobile apps.

You can integrate those network <Glossary>SDKs</Glossary> that you desire.
Then you can monitor the callbacks that MAX makes to your app that notify you of events for each ad format.
This way you can ensure that you have completed the integration successfully.

AppLovin recommends that you use [Test Mode](max-test-mode) with this Demo App as you load and show ads during the testing process.

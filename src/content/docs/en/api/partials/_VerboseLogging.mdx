To verify that you enabled verbose logs successfully you can check for the line that reads `Verbose Logging On: true` in the initialization section of the AppLovin <Glossary>SDK</Glossary> logs:

```plaintext
AppLovin SDK
Version: 11.4.2
⋮
Verbose Logging On: true
⋮
```

AppLovin <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> tags its logs with the tag `/AppLovinSdk: [AppLovinSdk]`.

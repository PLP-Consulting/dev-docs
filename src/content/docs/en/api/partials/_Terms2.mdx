<Callout type="note">
The <Abbr>TCF</Abbr> consent state may be false in either of the following two circumstances:

1. The user indicated that they do not consent to the terms of data collection that you specified in your message.
1. Some of the ad networks you have integrated into your application are not configured into <Abbr>UMP</Abbr>, and so <Abbr>UMP</Abbr> will always reject consent.
   See [Verifying Missing Networks](#vmn) to learn how to fix this.

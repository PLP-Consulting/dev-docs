### Testing Google <Abbr>UMP</Abbr> Integration with the Mediation Debugger

#### Verifying Installation

Under the <UILabel>Privacy</UILabel> section of the MAX Mediation Debugger, the <UILabel>CMP (Consent Management Platform)</UILabel> row displays the name of the Google-certified <Abbr>CMP</Abbr> <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> that you integrated.
If you have successfully integrated the Google <Abbr>UMP</Abbr> <Abbr>SDK</Abbr>, it displays “Google consent management solutions” as the name.

#### Verifying <Abbr>IAB</Abbr> <Abbr>TCF</Abbr> Parameters

If you select the <UILabel>CMP (Consent Management Platform)</UILabel> row, you can inspect the <Abbr>IAB</Abbr> <Abbr>TCF</Abbr> parameters <UILabel>IABTCF_gdprApplies</UILabel>, <UILabel>IABTCF_TCString</UILabel>, and <UILabel>IABTCF_AddtlConsent</UILabel>.
For the latter two, you can click on the row to copy or share its value.

#### Verifying Missing Networks

In the <UILabel>CMP CONFIGURATION</UILabel> section, you can verify which networks are integrated with or are missing from your Google <Abbr>UMP</Abbr> configuration.
This is an exhaustive list of all networks that are available to MAX, you can ignore any networks that you did not integrate in your application.

On your <Abbr>CMP</Abbr> flow you must list all of the networks that you integrate in your application.
To check if any of those networks are missing, first complete the <Abbr>CMP</Abbr> flow, granting consent to all networks, then open the Mediation Debugger.
The Mediation Debugger then parses the <Abbr>TC</Abbr> and <Abbr>AC</Abbr> strings and displays two lists:
one of integrated networks you listed on your <Abbr>CMP</Abbr> flow, and the other of networks that are missing which you might need to add (under <UILabel>Configured CMP Networks</UILabel> in the <UILabel>CMP CONFIGURATION</UILabel> section).

If you see any networks in the <UILabel>MISSING ATP NETWORKS</UILabel> or <UILabel>MISSING TCF VENDORS</UILabel> list that you have integrated into your application, return to your <Abbr>CMP</Abbr>’s dashboard and add the missing networks to those covered by the <Abbr>GDPR</Abbr> message (see [Customize Ad Partners List](#customize-ad-partners-list) for how to do this in Google’s Unified Consent Flow), then restart your app.
Repeat the steps to show the <UILabel>Configured CMP Networks</UILabel> list until you verify that all of your networks are correctly included in the <Abbr>CMP</Abbr> flow.

To check which of your integrated networks are missing from your CMP, first make sure that you have granted consent to all networks through your CMP flow. Then add the following networks to your CMP network list.

#### Verifying Mediated Network Consent Statuses

To view the consent statuses of all networks, expand <UILabel>Network Consent Statuses</UILabel> in the Mediation Debugger.
The Mediation Debugger parses the <Abbr>TC</Abbr> string and displays the consent statuses of all networks.
It also displays the AppLovin consent status parsed from the <Abbr>AC</Abbr> string generated by Google <Abbr>UMP</Abbr>.

With the AppLovin MAX <Glossary>SDK</Glossary>, you can expose comprehensive ad information in MAX-<Glossary>mediated</Glossary> apps.
You can identify problematic ads when you incorporate the creative debugger into your test environments, <Abbr>QA</Abbr> processes, and support ticket systems.

The creative debugger displays a button in the application for five seconds when you complete a special gesture (described in the video below).
If you then press the button that appears, you will see a new screen that contains a list of recently displayed ads.
If you select an ad from this list, information displays about that ad (such as its mediated <Glossary>network</Glossary> and <Glossary>creative</Glossary> <Abbr>ID</Abbr>), so you can report creative issues for that ad.

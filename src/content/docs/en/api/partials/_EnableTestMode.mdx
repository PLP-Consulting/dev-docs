When you turn off <UILabel>Test Mode</UILabel> on your device, ad units will revert to using the configuration listed in the MAX <UILabel>Ad Units</UILabel> page.
In addition to using Test Mode in the dashboard, AppLovin recommends that you use [Mediation Debugger Test Ads](mediation-debugger) as you quickly test the integration on your devices.

## Enable Test Mode

To enable Test Mode, select [<UILabel>MAX &gt; Mediation &gt; Manage &gt; Test Mode</UILabel>](https://dash.applovin.com/o/mediation/test_modes) and click [<UILabel>+&nbsp;Add Test Device</UILabel>](https://dash.applovin.com/o/mediation/test_modes/create/). 
  
![MAX Test Devices: + Add Test Device. Create your first Test Device. Test devices are used to verify successful integration of specific ad networks. By defining a test device and selecting a network, all valid MAX ad unit requests for that test device will initiate an ad request to the selected network with their test mode enabled.](/images/test-mode-01.png)

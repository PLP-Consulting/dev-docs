## Integration Status

The Mediation Debugger displays the integration status of the MAX-<Glossary>mediated [ad mediation]</Glossary> network adapters and/or <Abbr>SDK</Abbr>s found in your app.
It flags integration issues associated with each network (such as a mismatch between the network <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> and adapter version, or missing <Glossary>SKAdNetwork</Glossary> <Abbr>ID</Abbr>s).
It displays the integration status of mediated networks in three sections:

<UILabel>Completed Integrations</UILabel>
: You have successfully integrated these ad networks into your app.

<UILabel>Incomplete Integrations</UILabel>
: These ad networks have one or more issues you need to fix before you can integrate them successfully into your app.
  Tap on the cell for more information.
  You can find integration instructions in the [Preparing Mediated Networks](../preparing-mediated-networks) section of this documentation.

<UILabel>Missing Integrations</UILabel>
: You have not integrated these ad networks into your app.

## Testing with Test Ads

After you successfully integrate your mediated networks, AppLovin recommends that you validate your integration by loading and showing those networks’ test ads.

<Callout type="note">
Some mediated networks may have requirements that you must meet before you can load ads.
For example, the <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> may require enough time to fully initialize (this is true, for instance, for Liftoff Monetize).
If you do not allow sufficient time, this might cause no-fill errors.
AppLovin recommends that you load ads during the window from 2–5 seconds after you initialize the <Abbr>SDK</Abbr>.
</Callout>

To use the Test Ads feature,

1. Select a mediated network that you have successfully integrated, under the <UILabel>Completed Integrations</UILabel> section.
1. Tap <UILabel>Enable</UILabel> under <UILabel>Test Ad</UILabel>.
1. Restart the application so the mediated <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> initializes with test ad credentials.
1. Select the mediated network again to enter the test-ads view seen below:

## Testing with Live Ads

The Mediation Debugger allows you to view and test ads using your Ad Units’ waterfall configurations.

<Callout type="warning">
If you test with live traffic, some networks might flag this as fraudulent activity.
You might also experience issues getting filled due to your waterfall configuration or the network’s targeting parameters.
AppLovin strongly suggests that you test with live ads when you validate the integration.
</Callout>

To begin, select the <UILabel>View Ad Units</UILabel> cell, which displays the list of Ad Units associated with your app.
Select an Ad Unit from that list to view the waterfall configuration from the MAX Ad Unit section.

<Callout type="note">
Country and <Glossary><Abbr>LAT</Abbr> (Limit Ad Traffic) [lat]</Glossary> targeting rules apply to your device when you view and test live Ad Units.
</Callout>

### Full Waterfall

Select an ad unit from the <UILabel>Ad Units</UILabel> list and click the <UILabel>Load</UILabel> button to request an ad for the Ad Unit.

![INTER: Info, Bidding Networks. Tap to load an ad.](/images/mediation-debugger-full-waterfall-android.png)

### Single Ad Source

You can also select one of the mediated networks for the ad unit to be the only ad source for ad requests.
To do so, click one of the networks in the <UILabel>Bidding Networks</UILabel> list for that ad unit.
This isolates that network in the list. Next, click the <UILabel>Load</UILabel> button to request an ad from that network for the Ad Unit.

### Within the App

You can use the Mediation Debugger to force live ads from selected networks within your app’s natural environment.
To begin, select the <UILabel>Select Live Network</UILabel> cell and follow the instructions on the screen.

<Callout type="warning">
This feature is not available when test mode is enabled.
Several networks consider live ads on test devices to be fraudulent traffic.
AppLovin recommends that you use test ads to validate your integration.
You can use this feature to monitor live traffic.
</Callout>

## Sharing the Mediation Debugger

Quality reviewers may ask you to share a copy of your Mediation Debugger output before you push your apps live.
This ensures that your integration is healthy and ready to go live.

To share your Mediation Debugger output, click the share button at the top right of the Mediation Debugger home screen and complete the action using your preferred method.

## app-ads.txt

The Interactive Advertising Bureau created <Glossary>`app-ads.txt` [app-ads.txt]</Glossary> as a way for app publishers to prove to advertisers that they own the app that originates an ad request.
This prevents malicious actors from making fraudulent ad requests.

<Callout type="related">
[“Fight fraud and improve eCPMs: How to implement app-ads.txt for your app”](https://www.applovin.com/blog/fight-fraud-and-improve-ecpms-how-to-implement-app-ads-txt-for-your-app/) from the AppLovin <i>Mobile Apps Blog</i>
</Callout>

Starting in <Abbr>SDK</Abbr> version 11.6.0, you can check through the Mediation Debugger whether your `app-ads.txt` file contains properly formatted entries for AppLovin.
For more information on how to set up an `app-ads.txt` file on your domain with entries for AppLovin, visit [this link](../../max-dashboard/account/app-ads.txt-info).
The Mediation Debugger displays a row marked <UILabel>app-ads.txt</UILabel> under the <UILabel>MAX</UILabel> section with a <UILabel>✅</UILabel> if the `app-ads.txt` file containing all entries for AppLovin was successfully found under the root domain of your developer website listed on the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.

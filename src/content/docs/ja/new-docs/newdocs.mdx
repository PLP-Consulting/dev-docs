When a user interacts with a campaign link, their attribution information updates. This can happen if the user interacts with a [deep link](hc:deep-links). The SDK can listen for attribution changes and call a function when it detects an update.

You can set an attribution callback method by specifying an `attributionCallback` function in the [`initSdk` method](#web-initsdk-invocation).

Within your function, you have access to the user's attribution information.

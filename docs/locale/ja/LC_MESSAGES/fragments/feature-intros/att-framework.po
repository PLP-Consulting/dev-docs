"If you want to record the device's {abbr}`IDFA (ID for Advertisers)`, you"
" must display a prompt to get your user's authorization. To do this, you "
"need to include Apple's {abbr}`ATT (App Tracking Transparency)` framework"
" in your app. The Adjust SDK stores the user's authorization status and "
"sends it to the Adjust backend with each request."

"The Adjust SDK sends event and session data to Adjust's servers in real "
"time. You can pause the sending of information by putting the SDK in "
"offline mode. In offline mode the SDK stores all data in a local file on "

"disable offline mode."

"Your config object contains a boolean `isOffline` property that controls "
"this behavior. You can update this property at any time by calling the "
"[`setOfflineMode` method](ios-setOfflineMode-invocation) with a boolean "

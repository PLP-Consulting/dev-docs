Your config object contains a **string** {code}`externalDeviceId` property that you can use to store your external device ID. You can set property calling the {code}`setExternalDeviceId` method with your ID as an argument.

The external device ID is case-sensitive. If you have imported external device IDs, make sure the value you pass matches the imported value.
